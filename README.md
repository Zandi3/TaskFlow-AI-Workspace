# TaskFlow AI — Integrated Workplace Productivity Hub

TaskFlow AI is a unified, AI-powered workplace operations dashboard designed to eliminate context switching and automate everyday professional workflows. Built with a modern responsive UI, the platform transforms unstructured meeting notes, rough bullets, and task backlogs into execution-ready assets.

## 📌 Project Overview
Modern workplace productivity is fragmented across single-purpose tools. TaskFlow AI consolidates executive communication, meeting synthesis, task prioritization, and on-demand workflow support into a single dashboard. 

The platform leverages structured JSON prompt engineering and streaming LLM pipelines to provide reliable, formatted outputs while enforcing human-in-the-loop validation.
